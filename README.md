# Adjacency-List-Flights-
Created an Adjacency List by making a linked list of a linked list<br />
FlightPlan is driver program<br />
City is a single city object<br />
CityLinked is a single linkedlist of City<br />
AdjacencyList is where I create my adjacency list<br />


Sort of a visualization of the linked list of a linked list adjacency list <br />
